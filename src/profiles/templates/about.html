        <p>Bug Tracker is an application to track errors in software. It was created by Anthony Viera over the summer of 2020.</p>
        <p>
            Through the use of a ticketing system, Bug Tracker is able to record bugs or issues in a software development project.
            It also ensures user and role level security to ensure only authorized users can access tickets and projects. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This application was built using Django MVC and Python with a Postgres server database. Development was completed with
            Visual Studio Code 2019. Bug Tracker's webpages use HTML5 and Bootstrap 4.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Roles:</b> Bug Tracker has four roles that users can be assigned to. Users can have multiple roles and are
            automatically assigned as a Submitter upon registration.
        </p>
        <p>Below are brief descriptions of each role's permissions.</p>
