# Bug Tracker #

Bug Tracker is an application to track errors in software. It was created by Anthony Viera and primarily worked on over the summer of 2020 after graduating with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Texas in the spring of 2020.

Through the use of a ticketing system, Bug Tracker is able to record bugs or issues in a software development project. It also ensures user and role level security to ensure only authorized users can access tickets and projects.

This application was built using the Python framework Django and a Postgres server database. Deployment was completed using Heroku. Bug Tracker's webpages use HTML5 and Bootstrap 4. Static and media files are hosted by Amazon Web Service (AWS) S3 buckets.
